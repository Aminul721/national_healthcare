                   <p>From being operationally resilient to cross-training staff, Yishun Health remains equipped and ready to care for patients in the North, while also prioritising the well-being of staff. In the community, the Population Health & Community Transformation team continues to educate and empower residents and partners, and is a bedrock for the nation’s move towards a <em>Healthier SG</em>.</p>
                    <h4>COMMUNITIES OF CARE</h4>
                    <p>At Yishun Health, health is delivered and managed mainly outside the walls of its hospitals and in the community, where residents participate and care for one another (Participatory Care Ecosystem), and are supported by relevant services (Community Services Ecosystem). In a crisis, residents are linked to Safety Net Services from the formal healthcare system, after which they are supported in navigating their Communities of Care (CoCs). To build individual and community capacity and resilience to meet residents’ different health and care needs, Yishun Health aims to achieve a good balance of all elements of the CoCs, in partnership with residents and community based organisations.</p>

                    <p>In tandem with battling COVID-19, TTSH continues to forge ahead in transforming care for residents in the Central Region of Singapore. Its strong relationships with health and social partners, culture of continuous learning and innovation, as well as sustained emphasis on collective leadership, have been instrumental in building a ‘Community of Care’ to achieve better population health outcomes for a <em>Healthier SG</em>. </p>
                    <h4>OFFICIAL OPENING OF ANG MO KIO SPECIALIST CENTRE</h4>
                    <p>In March 2022, TTSH officially opened the Ang Mo Kio Specialist Centre (AMKSC), bringing affordable healthcare closer to the community. The event was graced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as Guest-of-Honour. To make healthcare more accessible to residents, AMKSC partnered with General Practitioners (GPs), polyclinics, and community partners to design and develop new services and models of care. These allow patients to seek treatment for specific conditions closer to home, while enabling more timely identification and management of potentially serious issues.</p>

                    <p>The TTSH CTF cared for COVID-19 patients who had recovered from the acute phase of their infection, but still required longer-term close monitoring. This facilitated the right-siting of patients and eased the patient load at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (../ncid), TTSH and other hospitals, allowing healthcare staff to better manage patients with more serious illnesses needing specialised acute and critical ICU care. Patients at TTSH CTF received therapy treatments, which focused on helping them regain their functional abilities by improving their strength and nutrition through close monitoring of their condition, and reconciling their follow-up appointments upon discharge and referrals to day rehabilitation and home nursing services, if needed. The CTF cared for over 400 patients between November 2021 and April 2022.</p>

					<h4>REDESIGNING CARE AND EDUCATION</h4>
                   <p><b>AMBULATORY EMERGENCY CARE (AEC) SERVICE</b></p>
					
					<p>KTPH launched the Ambulatory Emergency Care (AEC) Service — a first in Singapore — in September 2019. Under this new service, patients with acute medical conditions such as hypertensive urgency, severe anaemia, or deep vein thrombosis, can be treated without a long hospital stay. Patients are able to stay up to 23 hours in the AEC Unit, as well as go for follow-up at the AEC Clinic, if needed. Since the start of the AEC Service, the average length of stay per patient with acute medical conditions has shortened by 28.8 hours. It was presented the Best Practice Medal under the Care Redesign category at the National Healthcare Innovation and Productivity (HIP) Awards 2021.</p>

					<h4 style="color:#6088C3;">BUILDING BREAST CANCER SERVICES</h4>
					<p>In 2021, the KTPH Breast Unit implemented a ‘Fast Track Breast Clinic’ to provide seamless breast cancer evaluation for patients referred from polyclinics. The time taken to reach diagnosis was shortened from one month to about a week, which helped minimise patient anxiety as they waited for the results.</p>

					<h4 style="color:#6088C3;">REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) SERVICE</h4>
					<p>In January 2022, a team from the Department of Psychological Medicine at KTPH rolled out the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) service for patients with treatment resistant depression. rTMS is a brain stimulation method that has been shown to be effective for the treatment of major depressive disorder in patients who did not respond to conventional treatment with antidepressant medications. It is non-invasive, and uses a focused rapidly-changing magnetic field generated by a coil placed on the head to induce electrical pulses, to stimulate nerve cells in targeted areas of the brain. The procedure allows patients to return to their everyday activities, including work or school, immediately after treatment. KTPH plans to extend this service to patients from other public and private clinics, and healthcare institutions from early 2023.</p>
