                        Students enrolling in Nanyang Technological University (NTU)’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine) in 2024 will graduate with a medical degree awarded solely by NTU, unlike their seniors, whose degree certificates bear the names of NTU and Imperial College London. This marks the completion of LKCMedicine’s partnership with Imperial College six years from now, in 2028 as planned. Students who enrol this year or in 2023 and complete their five-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery programme by 2028 will still receive the joint degree from both institutions. Set up in 2010, LCKMedicine was designed to meet Singapore’s growing healthcare needs. It welcomed its first batch of students in 2013 who graduated in 2018. To-date, four cohorts of medical doctors have graduated from LKCMedicine and are now contributing to Singapore’s healthcare sector. The fifth cohort enrolled in May this year.

                        Dr Clement Chia, Consultant, Department of General Surgery, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH), initiated a Learning Oriented Teaching in Transdisciplinary Education (LOTTE) elective posting. The objective was to allow medical students to maximise their learning opportunities in two medical subspecialties, so as to better appreciate the benefits of working in a transdisciplinary collaborative environment. Launched in April 2021, the four-week programme saw students dividing their time equally between both of their subspecialties, attending to their rounds in the wards, clinics, and operating theatres, as well as conducting home visits.

					<h5>NHG RESIDENCY EXPANDS ‘SOAR’</h5>
					<p>NHG Residency expanded its common curriculum domain‘SOAR’ to include three domain areas of managing Self, managing Others, And building Resilience. The Self-Care 101 module was introduced in April 2021 to create awareness on the need for self-care and the effects of burnout, as well as equip residents with self-care and coping strategies. The module also guides residents to recognise emotional red flags so as to know when and where to seek help. Pilot courses on workplace mental wellness, mindfulness practice, and self-compassion training for the healthcare community were introduced in collaboration with NHG College, Brahm Centre, and the Mindful Compassion Project.</p>

					<h5>DEVELOPING MENTAL RESILIENCE</h5>
                    <p>
                        NHG College continued to work closely with core faculty teams from TTSH and Woodlands Health (WH) to develop and conduct Workplace Mental Health (Basic) and SAFETALK Suicide Prevention Workshops.

                    <p>
                        NHG College delivered 49 runs of faculty development programmes for some 1,909 educators from NHG Education. Two new workshops were launched in FY2021 — ‘Learning Facilitation’ and ‘Basic Psychometrics for Health Professions Education’ — aimed at equipping NHG clinical educators with facilitation and assessment concepts.
