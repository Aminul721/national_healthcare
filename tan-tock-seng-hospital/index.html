                    <p>In March 2022, TTSH officially opened the Ang Mo Kio Specialist Centre (AMKSC), bringing affordable healthcare closer to the community. The event was graced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as Guest-of-Honour. To make healthcare more accessible to residents, AMKSC partnered with General Practitioners (GPs), polyclinics, and community partners to design and develop new services and models of care. These allow patients to seek treatment for specific conditions closer to home, while enabling more timely identification and management of potentially serious issues.</p>

					<p>The suite of specialist care and services provided includes:</p>
					<p><b>Transdisciplinary diabetes care</b><br>
					Patients with diabetes are seen by specially-trained Clinical Diabetes Educators (CDE), who provide more holistic diabetes care education and advice, reducing cost and the number of clinic visits for patients while improving compliance and outcomes.</p>

                    <p>The TTSH CTF cared for COVID-19 patients who had recovered from the acute phase of their infection, but still required longer-term close monitoring. This facilitated the right-siting of patients and eased the patient load at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (../ncid), TTSH and other hospitals, allowing healthcare staff to better manage patients with more serious illnesses needing specialised acute and critical ICU care. Patients at TTSH CTF received therapy treatments, which focused on helping them regain their functional abilities by improving their strength and nutrition through close monitoring of their condition, and reconciling their follow-up appointments upon discharge and referrals to day rehabilitation and home nursing services, if needed. The CTF cared for over 400 patients between November 2021 and April 2022.</p>

					 <strong> Community Eye Clinic</strong>
                    <p>Patients with chronic eye conditions such as blurring of vision, suspected glaucoma, and who require post-cataract surgery follow-up are reviewed by optometrists, enabling faster access to care near their homes.  </p>

                    <strong>Community Hearing Evaluation  </strong>
                    <p> Audiologists provide basic hearing examinations, and hearing aid interventions, which allow more residents to be screened in the community, and facilitate more timely identification and management of hearing-related issues.</p>


                    <strong>Integrated musculoskeletal care services  </strong>
                    <p> 
                     AMKSC offers integrated musculoskeletal care services, whereby patients from the polyclinics or GPs, presenting with common musculoskeletal conditions, can access timely physiotherapy or occupational therapy services without needing to first see an Orthopaedic or Hand surgeon, thus reducing unnecessary wait time and costs. 
                    </p>
					
					<p>The co-location of TTSH’s Community Health Teams with the ambassadors at the Silver
Generation Office also helps to establish closer links between health and social care providers,
and foster more place-based models of care, active outreach to residents, and closer care coordination among partners and providers in the community.

                    <h4>OFFICIAL OPENING OF THE CLINIC FOR ADVANCED REHABILITATION THERAPEUTICS</h4>
                    <p>In April 2022, the TTSH Clinic for Advanced Rehabilitation Therapeutics (CART) celebrated its 10th Anniversary and expanded premises, which was graced by Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung. CART offers conventional therapy equipment and state-of-the-art rehabilitative robots to meet the growing demand for such services, helping patients with stroke, brain, and spinal cord injuries in their recovery journey. With its newly-expanded premises, CART now offers therapy for those with neurodegenerative disorders and patients recovering from multiple serious injuries.</p>
					
					<h4>‘WHAT MATTERS TO YOU’ WORKSHOP SERIES</h4>
					<p>To reach out to partners in the community, TTSH’s Psychology Department collaborated with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC)’s Silver Generation Division in July 2021 to launch the ‘What Matters to you’ workshop series, which focused on how to conduct meaningful conversations with seniors on their priorities, and engaging them to motivate and influence behavioural change to achieve better health and social outcomes. These workshops used a person-centred approach and leveraged relationship-based care to help seniors lead meaningful and fulfilling lives. Four workshops were conducted for AIC’s Silver Generation Officers (SGOs), and each workshop comprised two half-day sessions. Over 100 SGOs attended the training, and they have since trained other SGOs, and incorporated ‘What Matters’ conversations in the preventive health visits they conduct.</p>
					
					<p>Together with the Centre for Allied Health & Pharmacy Excellence (CAPE), the Psychology Department also conducted four workshops to train TTSH staff from various disciplines, including the Division of Central Health’s Community Health Team, Allied Health, nursing, pharmacists, and medical teams, to incorporate ‘What Matters’ conversations into care encounters.</p>

					<h4>POWERING UP PEOPLE, CHARGING UP LIVES</h4>
                    <p>TTSH’s Centre for Health Activation (CHA) launched the CHArge Up! Learning Programme in October 2018 to meet the health needs of neighbourhoods in Central Singapore. The programme aims to empower carers (patients, caregivers, volunteers, and residents) with the health skills, knowledge, and confidence to take charge of their health and, in turn, look after the health of others in the community. </p>
					
					<h4>ENGAGING RESIDENTS TO BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES</h4>
                    
                    <p> 
                     In May 2022, CHA and Kaizen Office engaged residents in Ang Mo Kio for guerilla research, the first session in two years since the COVID-19 pandemic. Themed ‘Building Healthier Communities’, the research kick-started a year-long quality improvement project aimed at strengthening the community-enabling programmes, aligned with <em>Healthier SG</em>. Residents were invited to identify and discuss specific factors affecting community health and how the community could help shape the health of each person.  
                    </p>
					
					<p>The co-location of TTSH’s Community Health Teams with the ambassadors at the Silver
Generation Office also helps to establish closer links between health and social care providers,
and foster more place-based models of care, active outreach to residents, and closer care coordination among partners and providers in the community.
