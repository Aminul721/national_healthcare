                        Although not fully out of the woods yet, we are now moving from a pandemic to an endemic
                        state. With our population largely vaccinated, we are able to ease out of most of the social
                        restrictions imposed during the pandemic. We are steadfastly gaining normalcy in our everyday
                        way of life.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My sincere gratitude to our NHG Family, partners, and supporters for your encouragement and
                        extraordinary show of solidarity, which propelled us forward in one of the most difficult
                        periods experienced.

                    <h5>Managing Better Health for Our Population</h5>
                    <p>
                        COVID-19 has also brought to the fore the importance of staying well through ownership of
                        one’s health. The COVID-19 experience gave us valuable insights on how self-care and
                        individual empowerment can prevent the onset of illness through a holistic preventive health
                        approach that essentially comprises Healthy Diet, Healthy Lifestyle, and Integrated and Quality
                        Care. As our hospitals and clinics progressively reallocate manpower and operational resources
                        from the management of COVID-19 patients back to managing the care of our population, we
                        shall stay true to our vision of Adding Years Of Healthy Life.

                        The release of the Healthier SG White Paper on 21 September 2022 marked a milestone in
                        NHG’s River of Life care transformation journey, bringing into alignment the focus on proactive
                        and preventive health. Under Healthier SG, the Ministry of Health (MOH) seeks to encourage
                        residents to build a trusted and lifelong relationship with their family doctor to meet their
                        health needs and to help modify habits for better health management. Additionally, MOH is
                        collaborating with the three public healthcare clusters, NHG, National University Health System
                        (NUHS), and SingHealth, to develop and sustain an integrated health and social ecosystem
                        within our respective regions to keep our populations healthy. Social and community agencies
                        such as the People’s Association, Health Promotion Board, and Sport Singapore will partner the
                        clusters to provide guidance on health interventions, activities, and programmes to achieve the
                        long-term health outcomes for our nation.
                    </p>

                    <P>
                        There is impetus for change as our current healthcare model is not sustainable; the projected
                        rates of healthcare costs based on our exponential increments over the years would greatly
                        impact the affordability of today’s healthcare system. As such, Healthier SG aims to future-proof
                        the healthcare ecosystem to provide accessible, affordable, and quality care for generations to
                        come.

                        Through Healthier SG, we will
                        engage more General Practitioners (GPs) to provide holistic care to more residents, with an
                        emphasis on upstream preventive steps, through regular screening, lifestyle modification, and
                        proactive disease management. We will be counting on our medical, nursing, and Allied Health
                        staff, and healthcare coaches to promote Living Well beyond the hospitals by reaching beyond
                        schools, workplaces, neighbourhoods, and the community.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Nurses form the largest professional group in the healthcare sector. They spend the most time
                        with our patients. As we dive deeper into collective partnerships with GPs, our nurses will play
                        bigger roles to support and strengthen interactions and relationships with both family
                        physicians and patients. They will be empowered with technological devices and data to help
                        drive the bulk of preventive services under Healthier SG.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our Pharmacists and Allied Health Professionals will also have their roles redesigned to align
                        with Healthier SG. To prepare for the shift, the NHG Group Pharmacy Council was set up in
                        November 2021 to shape and influence better delivery, better experience, and better value for
                        our patients. Similarly, the NHG Allied Health Council and NHG Group Allied Health are
                        spearheading efforts to rethink, redesign, and deliver meaningful Allied Health services to
                        support residents, patients, GPs, and community partners in their health goals and pathways.

                    <h5>Developing Mental Health Resilience</h5>
                    <p>
                        The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) has been a vanguard of mental health and an innovator in
                        destigmatising mental illness through public education and prevention. IMH rolled out seven
                        interactive training modules in August 2021, under the GP Partnership Programme, to deepen
                        GPs’ understanding of common mental health disorders and mental health issues. This
                        Programme equipped the GPs to support patients at the primary care level. Since its rollout,
                        more than 100 GPs have registered for the Programme.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        IMH is also embarking on the second nationwide Mind Matters: A Study of Mental Health
                        Literacy’ to monitor changing trends in knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about common mental
                        health disorders and management in the community. The one-year study began in August 2022
                        and involved some 4,000 Singapore residents aged between 18 and 65 years old. The findings
                        will provide valuable data for future public health policies to cultivate mental health resilience
                        in Singapore.

                    <h5>Investing in Digitalisation and Infrastructure </h5>
                    <p>
                        We achieved another milestone in our digital healthcare transformation journey when Tan Tock
                        Seng Hospital (TTSH), together with the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), Ang Mo KioThye Hua Kwan Hospital, and Ren Ci Community Hospital, successfully transited to the Next
                        Generation Electronic Medical Record (NGEMR) system on 30 July 2022. The NGEMR
                        harmonises processes across NHG and the NUHS, thereby enabling a more integrated and
                        seamless aggregation of, and access to, patients’ medical information across care teams and
                        partnering institutions. Also strengthened is our capacity to collate patient data and analyse
                        trends, patterns, and behaviours over time. As a result, patients will receive more timely and
                        coordinated care, and an improved experience with overall cost and time savings in the
                        long term.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        TTSH opened the Ang Mo Kio Specialist Centre (AMKSC) in March 2022. The Centre provides a
                        suite of specialist services closer to residents in the community such as transdisciplinary
                        diabetes care management, optometrist-led eye care, and audiologist-led hearing evaluation. In
                        line with Healthier SG, TTSH is partnering GPs and polyclinics to co-manage residents’ health
                        and care in the community. For example, GPs can refer their patients for specialist diagnostics,
                        therapy and procedures offered at AMKSC and receive updates on their patients’ progress for
                        continuing care.

                        We continue to enhance our infrastructure, with the new National Skin Centre (NSC) building
                        slated to open in 2023. It will house state-of-the-art facilities to enhance clinical functions,
                        training, and research. With more consultation rooms, a fully-equipped Day Treatment Centre
                        for outpatients, and skin imaging and skin physiology laboratories, it will provide a more
                        seamless and integrated care experience. The new building also features a Day Care Centre and
                        a Patient Education Centre for public use.

                        On the research front, NHG together with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the
                        Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) launched co11ab Novena (co11ab), a
                        S$15 million incubator to support biomedical technology (BioMedtech) start-ups, which are
                        making the leap from research and development into commercialising their innovations.
                        Located at NTU’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), the incubator aims to be a
                        national innovation and translational hub that brings together research, clinical, and venturecreation activities. It is scheduled to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2023.
