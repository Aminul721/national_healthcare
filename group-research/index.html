					<p><b>Palliative Care Centre for Excellence in Research and Education (PalC)</b><br>
					Jointly set up by NHG, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore)’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), and Dover Park Hospice, PalC focuses on two key aspects: providing palliative care education to upskill healthcare professionals in the care of individuals living with life-limiting diseases, and providing support for palliative care research through
the annual award of intramural grants. Research at PalC has improved understanding of integrated models of care, management of end-of-life symptoms, non-cancer palliative care, and support for healthcare professionals in palliative care. In October 2021, NHG renewed the partnership for another three years until FY2023.

					The BBS is a national initiative between NTU Singapore’s LKCMedicine, the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI), NHG, and National University of Singapore (NUS)’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine. As a brain donation programme and tissue repository, BBS enables future biomedical research to delve into the patho-etiology of neurodegenerative disorders like dementia and neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia. Since its launch, BBS has recruited more than 200 pledged donors and collected four brain and cerebrospinal fluid donations, allowing research in neurological/neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders to be performed using human tissues. In June 2022, NHG renewed the partnership for another three years until FY2024.

					<h5>NHG-LKCMEDICINE JOINT APPOINTMENTS</h5>
					
                    <p>
                        In September 2021, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was inked between NHG and LKCMedicine for no-cost reciprocal appointments. Through the framework, NHG and LKCMedicine would mutually appoint up to 6.0 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff for each discipline of common interest to the other institution. This timely move sets the stage for the joint establishment of an Academic Health System (AHS) in the future, facilitating cross-disciplinary learning and co-development of joint research programmes and translational platforms to raise NHG’s research intensity and competitiveness. 
					</p>
					<h5>ENTERPRISE SINGAPORE PACT FUNDING</h5>
					<p>
                        In 2021, Enterprise Singapore awarded NHG’s Centre for Medical Technologies and Innovations (CMTi) a new multimillion-dollar funding for five years from CY2021, the third to-date in recognition of the good outcomes achieved by CMTi in CY2020. The renewed funding will strengthen CMTi’s capabilities to support NHG clinicians in the following areas: 
					<ul>
					<li>•	Translating ideas into products</li>
					<li>•	Grooming and nuturing clinician innovators</li>
					<li>•	Introducing new technologies</li>
					</ul>
					
					</p>
					<p>
                        As NHG’s primary engine that drives innovation and translates ideas into implementable products and solutions, CMTi has facilitated more than 300 projects, and engaged close to 300 clinicians to-date. Together with clinicians, CMTi has attracted industry funding worth more than S$39 million, spun off 13 companies, filed over 140 patents, licensed more than 70 intellectual property to partners, and commercialised at least 24 products.

					<h5>INNOVATIONS IN COVID-19 RESPONSE</h5>
                    <p>
                        To meet the immediate needs of managing COVID-19, NHG CMTi launched a one-off COVID-19 MedTech Innovation Grant Call in April 2020 to support clinicians in their medtech development projects. This timely grant provided the much-needed funding for COVID-19-related projects in the areas of infection prevention and control, telemonitoring and rehabilitation, falls prevention and diagnostics, with close to S$0.5 million in funding awarded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since FY2021, the following three projects have been piloted and/or implemented in two NHG Institutions to help create a safe and clean environment for patients and healthcare workers:

					<p><b>Sunburst UV Disinfection Robot</b><br>TTSH’s Departments of Environmental Services and Infection Prevention and Control collaborated with PBA Systems Pte Ltd to co-develop and validate an enhanced version of the Sunburst UV Disinfection Robot, an autonomous ultraviolet-C (UVC) disinfection robot that disinfects high-touch surfaces in hospital environments.</p>
					
					<p><b>COVID-19 Swab Protection Shield</b><br>Dr Angeline Seah, Senior Consultant, Geriatric Medicine, KTPH; and Ms Foo Meow Ling, Senior Nurse Clinician, KTPH, partnered Clifford Dispensary and The Biofactory Pte Ltd to co-develop the COVID-19 Swab Protection Shield for patients during aerosol-generating procedures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 droplets/aerosol. </p>
					
					<p><b>Automated Hospital Cubicle Curtains</b><br>Led by Dr Yong Enming, Consultant at TTSH’s Department of General Surgery, a team from TTSH developed and tested an automated curtain device with motorised curtain hooks and sensor control to reduce potential ‘touch-based’ contamination.</p>

					<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to collaborative innovation outcomes in the following areas:</p>
					
                    <p><b>Rise of telehealth to enable access to remote assessment, monitoring, and care for our patients</b><br>In collaboration with Taggle Pte Ltd, NHG clinicians from multidisciplinary backgrounds have been working to co-develop Digital Health Applications (DHAs) that allow for remote assessment, monitoring, and treatment to help improve and optimise patient and healthcare outcomes:</p>
					
					<p><b>Heart-track</b><br>A full-fledged virtual mobile application-based multidisciplinary programme built for cardiac rehabilitation that allows patients to exercise independently within their targeted heart rate zone with continuous heart rate monitoring, and empowers them to live a heart-healthy lifestyle with modifications based on their individual risk factors.</p>

					<p><b>MoveVID</b><br>An interactive virtual mobile application and telerehabilitation platform that enables patients to have access to a self-directed pulmonary rehabilitation programme, including an educational exercise programme to empower patients to exercise at home for better quality of life.</p>

					<p><b>Surgical Enhanced Recovery Assistant (SERA)</b><br>A perioperative patient journey management application based on Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS®) principles. The application guides the patients in preparing for surgery, and monitors compliance to their tasks and recovery post-surgery.</p>
					
					<p><b>Speech Therapy Digital Suite</b><br>This comprises two applications. The first is a fit-for-purpose digital application designed for speech and voice treatment, which incorporates audio-video conferencing capabilities and allows real-time collection of voice and speech parameters without the need for additional equipment. The other is a comprehensive speech and language rehabilitation platform, which enables speech therapists to provide real-time, simultaneous feedback with an array of local resources in various languages for communication rehabilitation.</p>

					<p>The Heart-track, MoveVID, and SERA applications have been identified as initial programmes to be implemented on the NHG HealthApps Platform (HAP), which will pave the way for more DHAs to be developed to meet our population’s health needs.</p>

					<h5>Facilitating accurate and timely healthcare intervention</h5>
                    <p>
                        Associate Professor Tan Ern Yu, Head of Service, Senior Consultant, Breast and Endocrine Surgery, TTSH, and her team are collaborating with Onkolyze to develop artificial intelligence (AI) applications to improve the accuracy of breast ultrasound assessments. The team has developed algorithms aimed at identifying lesions of concern and which require biopsy for histological confirmation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TTSH Nursing and CoNEX Healthcare Pte Ltd collaborated and co-developed the Bedside Alarm Recognition (BAR), which has been designed to sense audio signals produced by medical equipment and relay them to an external alarm for timely intervention by healthcare professionals.
                    </p>
					<h5>GRANTS TO SUPPORT INNOVATION</h5>
					<p>CMTi has established two grants that run annually — the NHG CMTi MedTech Grant in February 2021 and the NHG CMTi-NHIC Joint MedTech Grant in May 2019. Both grants support clinicians in developing technologies to translate their ideas into meaningful products and solutions to address unmet needs in healthcare.</p>
