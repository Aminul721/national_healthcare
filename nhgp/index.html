                   <p>Primary care is the bedrock of Singapore’s care transformation journey. For more than two decades, National Healthcare Group Polyclinics (NHGP) has been working hard to achieve a future-ready primary care ecosystem — one that is sustainable, accessible, and effective in improving population health.</p>
                    <h4>COVID-19 VACCINATION PROGRAMME </h4>
                    <p>NHGP continued to play a key role in protecting the community against COVID-19, offering the vaccine at all seven polyclinics. In April 2021, Hougang Polyclinic organised a hybrid Mandarin dialogue session, in partnership with People’s Association (PA) and Ci Yuan Community Club, to help address residents’ concerns and queries on COVID-19 vaccination. As of 31 March 2022, some 255,000 doses of the vaccine were administered by NHGP to members of the public.</p>
					<h4>EXTENDED OPERATING HOURS TO COMBAT COVID-19</h4>
					<p>In response to MOH’s call for polyclinics to help manage the escalating number of patients with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), Woodlands Polyclinic and Kallang Polyclinic extended their operating hours on two weekends in February and March 2022.</p>

					<h4>OFFICIAL OPENING OF KALLANG POLYCLINIC TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY</h4>
					<p>In May 2022, NHGP officially opened Kallang Polyclinic to better meet the growing healthcare needs of residents in the area. The event was graced by Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung.</p>

                    <p>In tandem with battling COVID-19, TTSH continues to forge ahead in transforming care for residents in the Central Region of Singapore. Its strong relationships with health and social partners, culture of continuous learning and innovation, as well as sustained emphasis on collective leadership, have been instrumental in building a ‘Community of Care’ to achieve better population health outcomes for a <em>Healthier SG</em>. </p>
                    <h4>OFFICIAL OPENING OF ANG MO KIO SPECIALIST CENTRE</h4>
                    <p>In March 2022, TTSH officially opened the Ang Mo Kio Specialist Centre (AMKSC), bringing affordable healthcare closer to the community. The event was graced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as Guest-of-Honour. To make healthcare more accessible to residents, AMKSC partnered with General Practitioners (GPs), polyclinics, and community partners to design and develop new services and models of care. These allow patients to seek treatment for specific conditions closer to home, while enabling more timely identification and management of potentially serious issues.</p>

                    <p>The TTSH CTF cared for COVID-19 patients who had recovered from the acute phase of their infection, but still required longer-term close monitoring. This facilitated the right-siting of patients and eased the patient load at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (../ncid), TTSH and other hospitals, allowing healthcare staff to better manage patients with more serious illnesses needing specialised acute and critical ICU care. Patients at TTSH CTF received therapy treatments, which focused on helping them regain their functional abilities by improving their strength and nutrition through close monitoring of their condition, and reconciling their follow-up appointments upon discharge and referrals to day rehabilitation and home nursing services, if needed. The CTF cared for over 400 patients between November 2021 and April 2022.</p>

					<p>In line with <em>Healthier SG</em>, Kallang Polyclinic offers a range of healthcare services to help residents take charge of their health and well-being. Some novel initiatives that provide comprehensive care to improve patients’ overall health outcomes include: </p>
					
					<p><b>Fully-Automated Vaccine Management System</b><br>
					Kallang Polyclinic is the first NHG Polyclinic to pilot the use of a fully-automated Safety Manpower Productivity Accountability Real Time Analytics Vaccine (SMARTVacc) System, which enables live inventory tracking, and cross-checking of dispensed vaccines against an in-built image recognition system for enhanced patient safety.</p>

					<p><b>Patient Advisory Council</b><br>
					The Patient Advisory Council (PAC) comprises residents who are also patients of the polyclinic, caregivers, and/or volunteers, who help co-create care solutions. The PAC serves as a voice for patients and the community, with members sharing their experience and insights with the care team to achieve better health outcomes.</p>

					<p>Under the RELATE (RELationship-based HeAlth & Social InTEgration) programme, the NHGP care team works closely with community partners to identify and develop shared care plans to support elderly patients with complex medical and social needs.</p>

					<p>First introduced in Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic in September 2020, the programme is available at all NHG Polyclinics. RELATE patients will be supported through their healthcare journey by a Care Coach, who acts as a health buddy and a single point of contact between the patient and his/her healthcare team. This would help empower patients and families to navigate between NHGP, community partners, and hospitals.</p>

					<p>The EMBRACEPLUS (Enhanced Maternal Baby ToddleR And Child SurvEillancePLUS) Programme integrates NHGP’s maternal and child health services, and is aimed at strengthening the mother and child dyad, particularly for at-risk families. EMBRACEPLUS seeks to identify children aged 0 to 3 years old from low-income families, and address their health and social issues. When these children visit the polyclinics for their vaccinations and developmental assessments, they will be screened for other medical, care, and financial needs.</p>

					<p>Mothers will be screened for postnatal depression, and if required, be referred to the appropriate healthcare staff for interventions. For mothers with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy, the care team will review and manage their conditions accordingly.</p>

					<p>EMBRACEPLUS was first piloted at Yishun Polyclinic in September 2020, and will be available in all NHG Polyclinics by March 2023.</p>
